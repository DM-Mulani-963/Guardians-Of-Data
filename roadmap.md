- [ ] Perform integration testing for the entire application
- [ ] Gather feedback from beta testers to refine features
- [ ] Fix bugs and optimize performance

### Phase 5: Launch & Post-Launch
- [ ] Prepare marketing materials (screenshots, descriptions)
- [ ] Launch app on Google Play Store
- [ ] Monitor user feedback and performance metrics
- [ ] Plan for future updates (new features, security patches)

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] AI-based analysis for advanced privacy threat detection
