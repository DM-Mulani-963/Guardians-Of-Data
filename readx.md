Building an app like DATA Rakshak requires a robust and secure tech stack. Here’s a comprehensive tech stack recommendation for your project:

Tech Stack
Frontend
Language: Kotlin (for Android development)

Framework: Jetpack Compose (for modern UI development)

Libraries:

Retrofit (for network requests)

Glide or Picasso (for image loading)

Material Components (for UI components)

Backend
Language: Python

Framework: Django or Flask (for RESTful API development)

Libraries:

Django REST framework (for building APIs)

Celery (for asynchronous tasks)

PyJWT (for JSON Web Token authentication)

Database
Database: PostgreSQL (for relational data)

ORM: Django ORM (if using Django) or SQLAlchemy (if using Flask)

Permission Management
Library: EasyPermissions (for handling runtime permissions in Android)

Tool: AppOps (for advanced permission management)

Step-by-Step Development Process
Phase 1: Project Planning & Research
Define Problem Statement: Clearly outline the privacy issues your app will address.

Establish Key Features: List all the features your app will have.

Assign Roles: Allocate tasks to team members based on their expertise.

Research Implementation Options: Look into non-root methods for implementing privacy features on Android.

Phase 2: Setup & Design
Create GitHub Repository: Set up version control for your project.

Design UI/UX Wireframes: Use tools like Figma or Sketch to design wireframes for all features.

Develop App Architecture: Create a flow diagram to outline the app’s architecture.

Select Libraries/Tools: Choose the libraries and tools you’ll use for permission analysis and metadata cleaning.

Phase 3: Core Feature Development
3.1 Privacy Scoring System
Scan Installed Apps: Implement a feature to scan installed apps for permissions.

Develop Scoring Algorithm: Create an algorithm to assign privacy scores (Red, Yellow, Green).

Display Reports: Show detailed reports of high-risk apps with recommendations.

3.2 Permission Analysis
Categorize Permissions: Build a module to categorize app permissions (e.g., camera, location).

Summarize Risky Permissions: Provide a summary of risky permissions with user-friendly explanations.

Suggest Actions: Recommend actions like revoking unnecessary permissions.

3.3 Virtual Environment / Restricted Access Mode
Develop Sandbox Environment: Create a secure sandbox for app testing.

Simulate App Behavior: Allow users to simulate app behavior without accessing personal data.

Log Permission Requests: Log and display permission requests made within the sandbox.

3.4 Metadata Cleaning on File Sharing
Extract Metadata: Implement metadata extraction for common file types (images, documents).

Clean Metadata: Provide options to clean metadata before sharing.

Integrate Quick-Clean Button: Add a quick-clean button in the sharing interface.

3.5 User Privacy Tips & Management
Create Tips Section: Develop a section with dynamic privacy suggestions.

Notification System: Implement a system to alert users of risky permissions.

Settings Panel: Offer a settings panel for personalized privacy recommendations.

Phase 4: Testing & Debugging
Unit Testing: Conduct unit testing for individual features.

Integration Testing: Perform integration testing for the entire application.

Beta Testing: Gather feedback from beta testers to refine features.

Fix Bugs: Fix bugs and optimize performance.

Phase 5: Launch & Post-Launch
Prepare Marketing Materials: Create screenshots and descriptions for the app store.

Launch App: Release the app on the Google Play Store.

Monitor Feedback: Monitor user feedback and performance metrics.

Plan Updates: Plan for future updates (new features, security patches).

By following this roadmap and using the recommended tech stack, you’ll be well on your way to building a secure and efficient privacy-focused app. Happy coding!
